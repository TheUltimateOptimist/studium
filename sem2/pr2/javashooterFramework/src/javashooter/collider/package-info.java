/**
 * Package containing the main {@link Collider} class and its subclasses. Colliders detect pairwise
 * collisions between instances of {@link javashooter.gameobjects.GameObject}. Depending on the shape of an
 * object, you can use the elementary colliders to construct a complex shape, or create a new one
 * yourself by subclassing {@link Collider}.
